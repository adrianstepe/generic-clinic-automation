# Market Research & Validation

## The Idea
A plug-and-play automation system for dental clinics (and healthcare practices) that handles the entire patient booking lifecycle – online booking with upfront deposits, automated reminders, 6-month recall campaigns, and Google review requests – eliminating manual admin work and reducing no-shows.

## Problem Statement
Dental clinics lose revenue and staff time to manual booking admin and patient no-shows.

## Research Findings

### 1. Booking & Admin Workflows
**Finding:** The fundamental challenge is similar across all clinic types — they're drowning in manual administrative work.
- *Sources: 17 sources across Google, Reddit, YouTube, etc.*

### 2. No-Shows Cost Dental Practices Most
**Key Stats:**
- **15-30% no-show rates** in dental practices
- Each missed appointment loses **45-60 minutes** of productive chair time
- **61% of patients** would rather skip appointments than deal with inconvenient scheduling
- **80% prefer online booking**

**Takeaway:** This creates the strongest financial case for automated booking/reminder systems in dental vs. other clinic types.

### 3. Review Timing Drives Patient Acquisition
**Key Stats:**
- Dental practices with **500+ Google reviews** are winning patient acquisition
- **100+ reviews** generate **25% more new patient calls**
- The critical window is **15-30 minutes after treatment** while patients are still in the chair — once they leave, motivation to review disappears
- Each extra star boosts revenue by **5-9%**

**Takeaway:** Automated post-visit review requests (timed correctly) = competitive advantage.

### 4. Integration Problems Cause Patient Errors
**Finding:** The gap between practice management software and booking/forms/SMS systems causes **patient-facing errors and data inconsistencies**.
- One dentist solved it with Synchronizer dental API as middleware, cutting out all glue code
- The fundamental problem isn't lack of software — it's that **disconnected systems require expensive integration work**

**Takeaway:** A unified, plug-and-play system that doesn't require custom integration has strong appeal.

## Validation Summary
No-shows consistently emerge as a **significant pain point** in private dental clinics, with evidence pointing to strong demand for solutions that:
1. Reduce no-shows (deposits + reminders)
2. Eliminate manual booking admin
3. Automate patient retention (recall campaigns)
4. Drive reviews at the right moment

## Open Questions for Further Research
- What specific booking and admin workflows vary between different types of clinics (dental vs physio vs vet)?
- What existing tools are clinics currently using and why are they insufficient?
- What's the typical budget range clinics allocate for booking/admin software?
- How do clinic owners evaluate and decide on new software solutions?
- What are the key barriers to switching from their current system?
- How do deposit requirements affect patient booking behavior across different demographics?
