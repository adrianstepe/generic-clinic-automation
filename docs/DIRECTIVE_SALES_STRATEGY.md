# Directive: Sales & Outreach Strategy (TROJAN HORSE)

## Core Philosophy: "Do Not Burn The Crops"
*   **Market Reality:** Latvia is small (~160 clinics). Every lead is finite.
*   **Zero Tolerance:** No generic cold emails. No "spray and pray."
*   **The KPI:** Conversion Rate > Volume.

## 1. The "Trojan Horse" Strategy (Website First)
*   **The Problem:** Owners do not care about "widgets." They care about "image" and "patients."
*   **The Pitch:** "I noticed your website is broken on mobile / outdated. I mocked up a fix for you."
*   **The Mechanism:**
    1.  Use AI (Lovable/Bolt) to generate a premium landing page for the clinic.
    2.  Embed the Booking Widget naturally into this design.
    3.  Send a **video/screenshot** of THEIR new site effective immediately.
    4.  **The Hook:** "The website upgrade is free/cheap if you use my booking system."

## 2. Communication Channels (Digital First)
*   **Primary: Facebook Messenger**
    *   **Why:** High open rates, allows sending images (The Mockup) directly.
    *   **Tone:** Casual, technical, helpful.
*   **Secondary: Personal Email**
    *   **Target:** Owner's personal email (if FB invalid).
    *   **Tone:** More formal, subject line must be "Project" or "Website" focused.

## 3. The "Nadora" Priority (The First Domino)
*   **Status:** MUST CLOSE.
*   **Objective:** Secure Nadora as the "Reference Client" (Social Proof).
*   **Tactic:** Use "Nadora uses this" as the primary trust signal for all future sales.

## 4. Execution Protocol
*   **Before Contacting:**
    *   **Check Facebook:** Does the clinic have an active page? (Last post within 6 months).
    *   **Prepare Asset:** Capture screenshot of the generated Trojan Horse mockup.
*   **The Message:**
    *   **Hook:** "I found a mobile display error on your site."
    *   **Value:** "I mocked up a fix (see image)."

## 5. Anti-Patterns (Forbidden Actions)
*   Sending to `info@` without a specific name.
*   Mentioning "Automation" to Admins (Trigger word for "Job Instability").
*   Generic "I built a tool" pitches.
