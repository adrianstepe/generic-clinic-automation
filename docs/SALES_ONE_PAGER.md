# Dental Booking Automation — Sales One-Pager

---

## The Problem

**Dental clinics lose €3,000+/month** to manual booking admin and patient no-shows.

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| No-shows | 15-30% of appointments, €80+ lost each |
| Phone tag | Staff spend 2+ hrs/day on scheduling |
| Missed follow-ups | Patients forget checkups, revenue walks away |
| No reviews | Competitors with 100+ reviews get 25% more calls |

---

## The Solution

**A plug-and-play booking system** that handles everything automatically:

✅ **Online Booking + Deposits** — Patients book on your website, pay €30 upfront. No more no-shows.

✅ **Automatic Reminders** — Email + SMS 24 hours before. Patients don't forget.

✅ **6-Month Recall** — "Time for a checkup" emails sent automatically. Patients come back.

✅ **Google Review Requests** — Sent 30 mins after the visit. Your rating grows.

✅ **Dashboard for Staff** — See all bookings, update statuses. No switching apps.
