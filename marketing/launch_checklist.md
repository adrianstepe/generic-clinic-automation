# Launch Readiness Checklist

## Day 8: Mental Reset + Review

### Materials Review
- [ ] Re-read all cold emails – are they human and short?
- [ ] Re-read reply templates – do they sound like you?
- [ ] Review objection responses – practice saying them out loud
- [ ] Review lead list – do you have at least 15-20 Tier A/B leads?

### Simplification Check
- [ ] Remove any sentence that sounds "salesy" or corporate
- [ ] Remove any tech jargon that a receptionist wouldn't understand
- [ ] Shorten any paragraph longer than 3 lines

### Mental Prep
- [ ] Accept that most people won't reply – that's normal
- [ ] Accept that you might get some rejections – also normal
- [ ] Focus on helping, not selling

## Day 9: Final Polish

### Demo Video (if recording)
- [ ] Script is simple and focused on benefits, not features
- [ ] Video is under 3 minutes
- [ ] Audio is clear, no background noise
- [ ] Screen recording shows real flow (booking → confirmation → email)

### Landing Page Review
- [ ] All text is in final Latvian (no Lorem Ipsum)
- [ ] Price is correct (€99/mēnesī)
- [ ] CTA button works (or is clearly a placeholder)
- [ ] Page loads fast, looks good on mobile

### Email Test
- [ ] Send test email to yourself from sending account
- [ ] Check if it lands in Primary inbox (not Spam/Promotions)
- [ ] Read it on mobile – is it scannable?

## Day 10: Dry Run

### Test Email Sequence
- [ ] Send 3-5 test emails to personal accounts (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- [ ] Check delivery (no bounces)
- [ ] Check spam score (use mail-tester.com)

### Prepare Tracking
- [ ] Create simple spreadsheet:
  - Clinic name
  - Email sent date
  - Email version (Short/Neutral/Polite)
  - Response (Y/N)
  - Response type (Price inquiry, Demo request, Not interested)
  - Next action

### Final Checks
- [ ] Calendar is blocked for potential demo calls (Mon-Fri 10-17)
- [ ] Phone is ready (charged, ringer on during work hours)
- [ ] Reply templates are copy-pasteable (no edits needed)

---

## Launch Day (Jan 5)

### Sending Plan

- [ ] Alternate between email versions (Short, Neutral, Polite)
- [ ] Track each send in spreadsheet immediately

### Follow-Up Schedule

- Day 7: Final follow-up or move to "No response" pile

### End of Day

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Emails sent | 15 | |
| Open rate (if trackable) | 40%+ | |
| Reply rate | 10-20% (2-3 replies) | |
| Demo scheduled | 1-2 | |
| Immediate rejections | <50% | |

Even 1 demo booked in Week 1 is a WIN. Focus on learning, not perfection.
