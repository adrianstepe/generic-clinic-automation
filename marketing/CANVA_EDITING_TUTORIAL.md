## 2. The "Speed" & Cuts (Keep it Fast)
Canva has a simple video editor timeline at the bottom.

### Cutting the Boring Parts
1.  Move the playhead line to where you want to cut (e.g., waiting for a page load).
2.  **Right-click** on the timeline strip -> **Split Page** (or press `S`).
3.  Move to where the action starts again -> **Split Page** (`S`).
4.  Click the middle section (the boring part) and press **Delete**.

### Speeding Up (Typing)
1.  Click the clip section where you are typing.
2.  Click **Playback** (top menu bar) -> **Video Speed**.
3.  Set to **2x** or **2.5x**.

## 3. Text Overlays (The "Hook")
Since audio is usually off, text is key.

### Text Timing & Placement Cheat Sheet

| Text (Latvian) | Meaning | Timer | Position |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Ērts Online Pieraksts"** | Easy Online Booking | **0:00 - 0:05**<br>(Start of video) | **Center Screen**<br>(Big & Bold) |
| **"Klienti maksā uzreiz"** | Clients pay instantly | **0:25 - 0:35**<br>(During Stripe payment) | **Top or Bottom**<br>(Don't cover the card form) |
| **"Automātisks e-pasts"** | Automatic email | **0:45 - 0:50**<br>(When email opens) | **Left Side**<br>(Next to the email content) |
| **"Atbildiet, lai sāktu"** | Reply to get started | **0:55 - End**<br>(Last Scene) | **Center Screen**<br>(On black/colored background) |

**How to set exact timing in Canva:**
1.  **Right-click** the text box on the video.
2.  Select **"Show Timing"**.
3.  A purple bar appears on the timeline. **Drag the edges** of the purple bar to match the times above.

**Pro Tip:** Click "Effects" > "Background" to add a colored box behind text for readability.
